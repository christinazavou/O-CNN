## OCNN classification

input: DatasetFactory returns octree, label, filename. We use octree as input and we use label to calculate the loss.

## OCNN autoencoder

input: DatasetFactory returns octree, label, filename. We use octree as input

(Both points datafactory and octrees datafactory generate octrees.)
